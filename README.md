# ps6-webapp-eseele-uw - Bob Ross Statistics
ps6 interactive web app:

This interactive web app explores and analyzes the Bob Ross data set. This data set includes an analysis 
of each episode and its corresponding painting from Bob Ross' show. For each of these it includes each element 
from the paintings and how many times that element was included in the painting of that episode.

This interactive web app allows you to explore the relationship between the elements and the seasons of the show. 
It tracks the fluctuation of elements for each season and interperts this data in two different ways. One expresses
the data as a bar plot and the other expresses it as a table. 

## Plot
The bar plot expression of the data has two different option sets to choose how you would like to see the data.
The first is the color of the plot. You can choose from five different colors for the plot to be displayed with.
The second is the element choice. This option set allows you to choose which element you would like to further
investigate. A sentence below the plot will tell you which element you are currently analyzing. The plot itself
will show the number of times the chosen element was included in a painting for each of the seasons of the show. 

## Table
The table expression of the data shows the element and how many times it appeared in ranked order from most
appearences to least. This has one option set to choose from and it chooses which season you would like to look at.
There is also a sentence above the table that tells you which season you are currently looking at.
